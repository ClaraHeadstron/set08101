		<h3>Why I chose Napier</h3>
		
		<p>I was in a very lucky position in that i was accepted to all univeristies I applied to. I did 
		consider other univeristies but i knew that Napiers cyber secuirty course was really good and acclaimed by NCSC.
		Edinburgh is also quite a big city and I was excited to live in a larger place than my childhood village. I did seriously ocnsider Abertay 
		with Ethical hacking but i decided to choose Napier as i wasn't sure what i wanted to do explicitlty within Cyber and i thought it would be best to 
		have a broad education of different aspects of computing. I also enjoy the nightlife and larger sclae of Edinburgh</p>
